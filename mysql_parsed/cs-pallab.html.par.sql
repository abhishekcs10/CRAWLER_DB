The Formal Verification and CAD Research Group, IIT Kharagpur is one of the leading groups in the world in this area, known for its wide range of contributions in CAD for verification of VLSI circuits, automated control systems, networks, and embedded software. The group has collaborated with many leading industries including Intel, IBM, Synopsys, Google, Motors, Indian Railways, National Semiconductors, Hindustan Aeronautics, and Semiconductor Research Corporation.Professor Dasgupta has been named among the top 10 research contributors in Computer Science in India during the period 2002-2014 in a bibliometric study conducted by the Ministry of Science and Technology.The wordsCyber-Physical SystemsandIndustrial Internet of Thingsare buzzwords today in the EECS community. Software based embedded control is everywhere -- including home consumer electronics, power grids, handheld and wearable devices, automotive and avionics applications. CPS design requires interdisciplinary skills &ndash; control theory, electronics and design automation, and software. At IIT Kharagpur, researchers from Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science have come together to address some of the emerging research challenges in automotive control, safety critical avionic software, digital and analog integrated circuits, railway signalling and train control systems, and smart electrical grids. The formal verification and CAD research group offers an opportunity for addressing the challenges in studying such systems and proving that they are safe.Recent focus of the research group, in addition to its traditional strengths in circuits and systems, includes automotive and avionic control systems, security of automotive electronics, railway technologies and embedded safety critical software.
