Some of the problems I have worked on in recent times include coverage in wireless sensor networks, event and data dissemination in vehicular ad hoc networks, and desgning algorithms for time-varying graphs that can model many dynamic network scenarios. Recently, I have also been interested in scheduling and coordination problems that exist in smart grids, where I have worked on the problem of charge scheduling of electric vehicles in smart grids.
