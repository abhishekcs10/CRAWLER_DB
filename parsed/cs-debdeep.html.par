Research$ At IIT Kharagpur, under the theme of Secured Embedded Architecture Laboratory (SEAL), we have#been working for around last 8 years on several aspects on Hardware Security. The laboratory has produced several PhD students on the topics of Hardware Design of Complex#Cryptographic hardware on FPGAs (Elliptic Curves and Pairings), Side Channel Attacks (Power, Faults, and Cache analysis on ciphers), Boolean Functions for Cryptography to resist side channel analysis (like Power and Fault Analysis). There are also large number of graduated Master of Science students, who have worked in the area of Elliptic Curve Hardware for FPGAs. At present there are registered around 12 students working for their PhD students and Master of Science working on several topics of Hardware security, encompassing light weight cryptography, power attacks, fault and micro-architectural attacks, design of Physically Uncloneable functions (PUFs), design and protection against Hardware Trojans. The laboratory also has one Post-Doctoral researcher who is a PhD from NTU-Singapore, and is collaborating on the topics of Hardware Security.   #
