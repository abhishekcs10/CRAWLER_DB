Research$ Prof Partha P Chakrabarti&rsquo;s areas of interest include Artificial Intelligence (AI), Formal Methods, CAD for VLSI &amp; Embedded Systems, Fault Tolerance, Algorithm Design and Digital Repositories.#&nbsp;#His main focus is in the area of Artificial Intelligence Algorithms and Development of Automated Reasoning Frameworks that combine search, optimization, deduction, learning and decision making, especially under time and memory constraints. He is interested in applications of the above methods to design, analysis, synthesis, scheduling and verification of complex fault tolerant embedded real-time systems including digital, mixed signal, automotive, microfluidics, etc.#&nbsp;#He is also interested in design of large complex digital repositories and leads national efforts related to the National Digital Library of India, the Digital Earth Initiative, Science and Heritage (SANDHI), Signals &amp; Systems in Life Science, etc., which enable the use of search, reasoning and data analytics to problems of societal use.#&nbsp;#He is also keen in developing teaching innovations and academic networks. He leads the national effort on GIAN and has been a key contributor to NPTEL, T10KT, Pedagogy, etc.   #
