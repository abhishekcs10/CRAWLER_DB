Research$ Program source code is not amenable to efficient processing. Consequently, various types of modes of program such as dependency model, flow model, state model, interaction model, etc. can be extracted from source code. Of course, the models would differ in their syntax and sematics for different programming paradigms sporting different programming features and concurrency. Once a suitable program model has been defined, it is used for various software engineering tasks such as test coverage analysis, test case generation, regression test case selection, test prioritixation, optimization, fault-localization, etc.   #
