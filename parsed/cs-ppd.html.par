Research$ I am deeply interested in Heritage. &ldquo;Computer Analysis of Bharatanatyam Dance&rdquo; is an exciting research project that I initiated few years back. We capture the dance with Kinect and then perform various audio, video, motion, and human-movement analyses to recognise the forms. It is wonderful to work with the experts from a different universe.#While at the industry, I observed critical lacunae in the working of our young developers which lead to poor work quality and low productivity. In India, we have quantity &ndash; we do not have quality. Leveraging recent advances in sensor (Eye-Gaze Tracking) and processor (dynamic instrumentation) technology, I am trying to build tools for quality and productivity estimation and enhancement.#With my Director, I lead the &ldquo;National Digital Library of India&rdquo; Project of NMEICT, MHRD. We are building an educational portal for all students of India. Very soon this will become the de-facto platform for e-Contents and e-Learning in India. In this connection I take up various research problems in Technology-Enabled Education.   #
