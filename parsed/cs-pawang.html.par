Research$ My research focuses mainly on text mining for information extraction from the Web, Social Media and scholarly articles. Some of the research problems that I am tackling include extracting diverse opinions from online news and user generated content, summarizing tweets in disaster scenario for situational updates, novel word sense detection using content analysis, spam detection in video metadata using user comments, wikification of scientific articles etc. I am also working on computational models for prediction as well as recommendation, e.g., future citation recommendation, tag recommendation in community question answering etc. I am also actively working in the field of#Sanskrit Computational Linguistics.   #
