Research$ Presently I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. Prior to this, was an Assistant Professor in the same Department. Even before, I was working as a post doctoral researcher in the Complex Systems Lagrange Lab, ISI Foundation, Italy. I received my PhD from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur with a thesis on&nbsp;#self-organization of human speech sound inventories#. My main research interests center around applying complex system approaches (mainly complex networks and agent-based simulations) to different problems in (a) human language evolution and change, (b) web social media, (c) information retrieval and (d) natural language processing. I am a member of the Complex Networks Research Group (CNeRG):http://www.cnergres.iitkgp.ac.in/   #
